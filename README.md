# dotfiles

My Unix dotfiles (OSX and Linux compatible)

Terminal and evironment setup is a very personal thing, so you probably shouldn't use these dotfiles as a whole.

But still, feel free to poke around, you may take some inspiration and improve your own setup.

## Installation

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:szajbus/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles && sh install.sh
```
